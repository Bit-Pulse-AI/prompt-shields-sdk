## 1. Summary

Prompt Shields already sits in the request path through the SDK and the gateway, and
already knows *what kind of data* each call carries. This PRD turns that position into
a **cost-optimisation layer**. It covers four capabilities:

- **Sensitivity-aware routing.** Regulated or PII-heavy calls go to a sovereign EU/Nordic
  model. Routine calls go to the cheapest model that passes the customer's quality bar.
  Hard calls go to a frontier model.
- **Semantic caching.**
- **Per-team spend governance.**
- **Verified savings reporting.**

It is built as a **module of the existing product, not a pivot**. Security stays the
moat. Savings open a second budget, so the buyer becomes **CISO + CFO** instead of the CISO alone.

The first deliverable is not the router. It is an **AI bill teardown** toolkit. It
replays a customer's anonymised logs offline through the routing policy and an
evaluation harness, and reports savings at measured quality parity. That toolkit backs
the 6-week market test in the memo. Online routing, which is most of the engineering,
is built only once the memo's go criteria are met.

## 2. Guiding principles (from the memo)

These are product constraints. Every design decision below traces to one of them.

| # | Principle | Design consequence |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Extend, don't pivot.** We are not an inference provider and not a generic EU router. | No token resale and no hosted multi-tenant inference endpoint. The router is a module of the SDK and gateway we already ship. |
| P2 | **Security is the moat.** We route by *data sensitivity*; other routers route by price and latency. | Data-policy constraints run **before** any cost optimisation, and they fail closed. |
| P3 | **Bring your own keys.** No working-capital risk, and no race over a 5% margin. | The customer's provider keys stay in the customer's process or gateway. The catalog lists providers but never proxies billing. |
| P4 | **Prove savings, don't claim them.** The business model is a share of verified savings against an audited baseline. | Counterfactual cost, price-catalog versioning and per-customer quality evals are first-class features, not reporting add-ons. |
| P5 | **Capacity is not our game.** EU providers run short of capacity. | Multi-provider failover is mandatory, not optional. The catalog treats Berget, Infercom, Mistral EU, Regolo, IONOS, STACKIT, Melious and EUrouter as **supply**. |
| P6 | **Test before building.** | Phase 0 serves the teardown offer. Online routing is gated on the memo's go/kill criteria (§8). |
| P7 | **Conservative on quality.** A cheaper model that fails on a regulated task is a liability. | Defaults favour quality. Downgrades require a per-customer eval pass. A content-filter refusal never triggers a fallback to a laxer model. |

## 3. Context

### 3.1 Market (summary of the memo; figures from secondary reports, validate before external use)

- **Prices are falling fast.** Equivalent-capability inference prices fall about 50x per
  year at the median. A usage-weighted token index reached about $0.97 per million tokens
  in September 2026. Open-weight models carry about half of production tokens.
- **Spend pain is still rising.** 98% of FinOps teams now manage AI spend, 72% of
  organisations had a surprise AI bill, and about 26% of AI spend is estimated to be
  wasted. Granular attribution is the top unmet need.
- **Routing works.** RouteLLM reported 85% savings at 95% of GPT-4 quality on MT-Bench,
  and industry reports range from 30% to 85%. *The cheapest token is rarely the cheapest
  solved task.*
- **The competitive lane:**
  - Global routers (OpenRouter, OrcaRouter) lead on breadth and price.
  - EU routers (Melious, EUrouter, Cortecs, Eden AI) route on price and latency, not on
    sensitivity, and have no enterprise DLP.
  - Portkey is closest to us (gateway + guardrails), but has no EU sovereignty or Purview story.
  - AI FinOps tools (Vantage, Datadog and similar) report spend but cannot lower the
    cost per request.

**Our wedge:** we are the only player that is (a) already in the request path with
CISO trust, (b) already classifying data sensitivity on every call, and (c) already
attributing each call to a business unit and use case in a registry an auditor can read.

### 3.2 What exists in this repository today

| Capability | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Route hints (`RouteHint` → `X-PS-Quality`, `X-PS-Max-Cost`, `X-PS-Route`, `X-PS-Cache`) | `packages/sdk/prompt_shields/types.py` | Shipped. The SDK never routes. |
| Cost-aware router (`HeuristicStrategy`, `RoutePolicy`, budget clamp) | `gateway/src/middlewares/router/` | Shipped behind `PS_ROUTER_ENABLED`. Groups are cheap / balanced / frontier, with **no sensitivity input**. |
| Exact-match response cache with `X-PS-Cache` on/off/refresh | `gateway/src/middlewares/cache/` | Shipped (simple mode only). |
| PII category detection | `packages/sdk/prompt_shields/pii.py` | Regex and keyword based. The README states it is "a signal, not a DLP control". There are no Nordic identifiers (e.g. Norwegian fødselsnummer). |
| Ownership attribution (`business_unit`, `use_case`, `owner`, `data_classification`) | SDK, gateway `X-PS-*` headers, registry | Shipped. This is the basis for spend attribution. |
| `requested_model` / `served_model` | SDK + gateway telemetry | Shipped. |
| Pricing | `pricing.py`, hand-copied into `router/policy.ts` | 14 models, Q1-2026, input/output only. |

**Gaps:**
1. **Cost is priced at the *requested* model, not the served one** (`client.py`,
   `_build_event`). A `model="auto"` call records `cost=None`.
2. **No cached-token, reasoning-token, long-context-tier or batch pricing.** Streaming
   calls record no usage. Both make cost figures unfit for a savings-share contract.
3. **No jurisdiction or hosting metadata** on models or providers, and no EU-sovereign providers.
4. **The router has no sensitivity input,** and each SDK client is locked to one vendor.
5. **No offline replay or eval tooling,** so savings cannot be shown before deployment.
6. **No budgets and no anomaly alerts.**

## 4. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- **G1 Teardown.** A customer (or we, as a concierge service) can replay a week of logs
  and get a savings report at measured quality parity within one working day.
- **G2 Sensitivity-aware routing.** No call with declared or detected sensitivity
  above the policy threshold is ever served outside its allowed jurisdiction. This
  holds in the gateway and in SDK local mode.
- **G3 Cheapest capable model.** Routine traffic is routed to the cheapest model that
  passes the customer's quality bar, with multi-provider failover.
- **G4 Auditable savings.** Every routed call carries a counterfactual cost against a
  baseline frozen at onboarding. The savings report reconciles to provider invoices within ±2%.
- **G5 Spend governance.** Per-team budgets, attribution by business unit and use case,
  anomaly alerts, and an export for the Purview/Defender story.
- **G6 Drop-in.** Existing `ShieldsOpenAI`, `ShieldsAnthropic` and gateway users see no
  behaviour change unless they opt in.

### Non-goals

- Operating GPUs, reselling tokens, prepaid credits or a hosted public router endpoint (P1, P3).
- Competing on model breadth with OpenRouter. The catalog covers models our customers use,
  plus sovereign supply.
- **Prompt rewriting or anonymisation in v1.** "Anonymise, then route" is the memo's
  long-term unlock. The current PII engine is not reliable enough to *transform* prompts
  safely. It is scoped as a gated Phase 3 item (§7.9).
- A TypeScript application SDK, and routing for embeddings, images or audio.

## 5. Users

| Persona | Job to be done | What they buy |
|---|---|---|
| **CISO / DPO** | "Confidential and personal data never leaves the EEA. I can prove it per call." | The sensitivity policy, evidence of where each call was served |
| **CFO / FinOps** | "Cut the AI bill, attribute it to teams, and stop surprise bills." | Teardown report, budgets, anomaly alerts, savings report |
| **Platform engineer** | "One policy, enforced at the gateway, with no per-team code changes." | Gateway router + cache + policy file |
| **App developer** | "Cheapest good-enough model, with failover, and no retry code." | SDK `ShieldsRouter` / `model="auto"` |

## 6. Architecture

### 6.1 One policy, three enforcement points

```
                 route-policy.v1  (YAML/JSON, one schema, versioned)
                 model catalog    (prices + capabilities + jurisdiction)
                        |
      +-----------------+------------------+
      v                 v                  v
 Offline replay     Gateway router      SDK local mode
 (teardown CLI)     (org-wide,          (teams without the gateway;
  Phase 0           zero code change)    ShieldsRouter)
                     Phase 1             Phase 1
```

The policy schema, the catalog and a set of **golden decision vectors** are the
contract. The Python implementation (SDK and teardown) and the TypeScript implementation
(gateway) must both pass the same vectors in CI. Code is never copied across the
MIT/Apache boundary (see CONTRIBUTING). Only data files are shared.

### 6.2 Request flow

```
Intercept -> Classify -> Constrain -> Route -> Cache -> Call (+failover) -> Record
             sensitivity  jurisdiction  cheapest     tenant-   provider        cost, counterfactual,
             + complexity allow-list    capable      scoped    failover        served jurisdiction
```

1. **Intercept.** Through the SDK, the gateway, or (offline) a log file.
2. **Classify.**
   - *Sensitivity* = max(declared `data_classification`, PII-escalated level). It is
     **escalate-only**: detection can raise sensitivity but never lower it. An unknown
     or failed classification counts as the policy's `unclassified_default`, which is
     `confidential` out of the box.
   - *Complexity* uses the existing heuristic (tokens, code, schema), with a learned
     classifier later. Target under 10 ms.
3. **Constrain.** The sensitivity level maps to allowed jurisdictions, providers, ZDR
   and residency. Candidates outside the allow-list are removed. **If none remain, the
   call fails closed** with `PolicyViolation`. It is never downgraded to a non-compliant model.
4. **Route.** Among the remaining candidates that meet the use case's quality bar, pick
   by strategy (cheapest, latency, or balanced) within `max_cost` and the budget.
5. **Cache.** The cache is tenant-scoped. It is off by default for sensitivity ≥
   `confidential`. Flagged responses are never cached.
6. **Call + failover.** Fall back within the same constraint set only (§7.5).
7. **Record.** Telemetry carries the served model, provider and jurisdiction, the cost
   breakdown, the counterfactual cost and the policy version.

## 7. Components

### 7.1 Model & provider catalog (`catalog.json`, shared data file)

- **Prices.** The schema is field-compatible with LiteLLM's
  `model_prices_and_context_window.json`. It covers input, output, cache read, cache
  write (5m/1h), reasoning, `above_200k` tiers and batch/flex.
- **Capabilities:** `tools`, `json_schema`, `vision`, `reasoning`, `max_input_tokens`.
- **New sovereignty fields:**
  - `provider_hq_country`, `hosting_countries`, `jurisdiction` (`EEA` / `NO` / `US` / …)
  - `us_cloud_act_exposure` (bool)
  - `zdr`, `trains_on_data`
  - `certifications` (ISO 27001, C5, SecNumCloud…)
- **Initial sovereign supply** (OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so one adapter covers them):
  Berget AI (SE), Mistral regional EU endpoints, Infercom, Regolo (IT), IONOS, STACKIT,
  Scaleway, OVHcloud. Melious and EUrouter are listed as aggregators. There is a
  Norway-hosted slot for when a partner exists (memo open question).
- **Built by** `scripts/build_catalog.py`. It emits the SDK file and the gateway policy
  defaults, and a CI drift check fails the build if they differ. Every event records
  `price_catalog_version`.
- An unknown model has cost `None` ("unmetered"), never 0.

### 7.2 Sensitivity classification & data policy

```yaml
sensitivity:
  unclassified_default: confidential
  pii_escalation:                    # detected category -> minimum level
    health_data: restricted
    national_id: restricted          # incl. NO fødselsnummer, SE personnummer, DK CPR
    iban: confidential
    email: internal
data_policy:
  public:       { jurisdictions: [any] }
  internal:     { jurisdictions: [EEA, US], require_zdr: false }
  confidential: { jurisdictions: [EEA], require_zdr: true, us_cloud_act_exposure: false }
  restricted:   { jurisdictions: [NO, EEA], providers: [berget, mistral-eu], require_zdr: true }
```

- Add Nordic identifier detectors to `pii.py`: Norwegian fødselsnummer with mod-11
  checksum, Swedish personnummer with Luhn, Danish CPR, and Finnish HETU. Checksums cut
  the false positives that the README already admits to.
- Documentation must state plainly that detection only *escalates*. A missed detection
  falls back to the declared classification and `unclassified_default`, never to
  "public". This is how the router stays safe with a regex engine.

### 7.3 Routing strategies & quality bar

- A Python port of the gateway's `RouterStrategy` interface. Strategies: `Heuristic`
  (existing), `Cheapest`, `Latency`, and a `Learned` adapter later.
- **Quality bar per use case:**
  - The policy can pin `min_group` (e.g. `frontier` for `legal-review`).
  - Optionally, an `eval_set` id. A model is eligible for that use case only after it
    passes the set at ≥ the configured parity (default 95%).
- Precedence is unchanged from the gateway: explicit group > hints > policy default.
  Data-policy constraints sit above all of them.

### 7.4 Eval harness (`prompt_shields.evals`)

- **Inputs:** a golden set (customer-provided prompt/expected pairs, or prompts with a
  rubric) and a list of candidate models.
- **Scoring:** exact match, schema validity, or LLM-as-judge (pairwise against the
  baseline model's answer). The judge model is itself policy-constrained, so restricted
  data is never sent to a non-compliant judge.
- **Output:** a parity score per (use case, model) with a confidence interval. The result
  is written back into the policy as eligibility and is versioned. This is what turns
  "same performance" from a claim into evidence (P4).

### 7.5 Failover engine

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| 429 | Respect `Retry-After` up to `max_wait`, then move to the next candidate **within the same constraint set** |
| 5xx, timeout, connection error | Next candidate. A circuit breaker per provider handles EU capacity shortages (P5) |
| Context length exceeded | Next candidate with a larger window that is still compliant |
| 400 / 401 / 403 | Raise. No fallback. |
| Provider content-filter refusal | Raise by default. Falling back to a laxer model is a policy-evasion path (P7). |
| Stream already emitting tokens | Never retry |
| No compliant candidate left | `PolicyViolation`. Fail closed. |

### 7.6 AI bill teardown toolkit (`packages/teardown`, Phase 0)

This is the concierge MVP from the memo, and later a self-serve product.

- **Inputs, any of:**
  - provider usage exports (OpenAI and Anthropic usage CSV/API)
  - gateway logs
  - SDK/registry events
  - a JSONL of `{messages, model, usage, metadata}`
- **Prompt-text handling:** prompt text is optional. Without it, the toolkit produces a
  *cost-only* teardown: attribution, cache-hit potential from request hashes, and price
  arbitrage on the same model.
- **Runs on the customer's machine** (`ps-teardown run logs.jsonl --policy policy.yaml`),
  so logs never leave their environment. This supports the CISO sale and the memo's
  "anonymised logs" constraint.
- **Pipeline:**
  1. Normalise.
  2. Classify sensitivity and complexity.
  3. Apply the policy and produce a routing decision per call.
  4. Optionally re-execute a stratified sample on the candidate models with the
     customer's keys.
  5. Score with the eval harness.
  6. Price with the catalog.
- **Output:** a report in HTML and JSON with these sections:
  - baseline spend
  - projected spend by strategy
  - savings at parity ≥ 95%
  - sensitivity mix (share of traffic that *must* stay sovereign)
  - cache-hit potential
  - top cost drivers by business unit and use case
  - quality-parity table
  - methodology appendix: catalog version, sample size, judge model
- The memo's go criterion ("≥ 30% savings at ≥ 95% parity") is read straight off this report.

### 7.7 Semantic cache (Phase 2)

- Extend the gateway cache (`middlewares/cache`, simple mode today) with a `semantic`
  mode: embeddings plus a similarity threshold.
- **The key always includes** tenant, use case, served model and policy version.
- Off by default for sensitivity ≥ `confidential`. Never caches content-filter
  responses. The embedding model is policy-constrained too.
- Cache hits are reported as savings with `cost_source="cache"`.

### 7.8 Spend governance (Phase 2; folds in the memo's idea B)

- **Budgets** per business unit, use case or team, by day, week or month. Modes:
  `warn` / `downgrade` / `block`.
  - The gateway enforces them org-wide with a shared store.
  - The SDK enforces them per process, or through a Redis `BudgetStore`.
- **Attribution.** The registry already holds `business_unit` / `use_case` / `owner`.
  Add cost roll-ups and a FOCUS-compatible export so FinOps tools can ingest it. Follow
  the Linux Foundation Tokenomics work for alignment.
- **Anomaly alerts** on spend-rate deviations per use case (e.g. more than 3σ above a
  7-day EWMA), via webhooks.
- **Audit export.** Per-call routing evidence (jurisdiction, policy version) in a
  shape that can feed the Purview/Defender integration.

### 7.9 Anonymise-then-route (Phase 3, gated)

This is the memo's biggest unlock: once a prompt is scrubbed, a cheaper external model
becomes acceptable. The design is reversible pseudonymisation. Entities are replaced
with tokens before the call, and the original values are restored in the response
locally. **The gate:** it ships only after the detection engine reaches a measured
recall target on a labelled Nordic and EU PII set. Until then, sensitive traffic is
*routed* to a sovereign model and is *not rewritten*. That matches the README's honest
framing of the current PII engine.

### 7.10 Verified savings & baseline

- **Baseline.** At onboarding, freeze the customer's model mix plus the catalog version
  as `baseline_id`. The counterfactual cost of each call equals the call's actual token
  usage priced at the baseline model for its use case.
- Savings = Σ(counterfactual − actual), with cache hits and routed calls reported separately.
- The reconciliation report compares our figures with the provider invoice. A gap of
  more than 2% marks the period as `unreconciled`. This is what makes a share-of-savings
  contract defensible.

### 7.11 SDK developer experience

```python
from prompt_shields import ShieldsRouter, RouteHint

client = ShieldsRouter(
    providers={                                   # BYOK; keys never leave the process
        "openai":     {"api_key": ...},
        "anthropic":  {"api_key": ...},
        "berget":     {"api_key": ..., "base_url": "https://api.berget.ai/v1"},
        "mistral-eu": {"api_key": ...},
    },
    ps_api_key="ps-...",
    business_unit="Claims", use_case="claim-summary",
    data_classification="confidential",           # -> EEA-only, ZDR
    policy="ps-route.yaml",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(model="auto", messages=[...],
                                      route=RouteHint(quality="balanced"))
resp.ps.route        # model, provider, jurisdiction, reason, policy_version
resp.ps.cost         # breakdown, counterfactual, source
resp.ps.attempts     # failover chain
```

- Responses always come back in the OpenAI chat-completions shape, with `raw` kept for
  native access. `ShieldsRouter(mode="gateway")` delegates the decision to the gateway
  through the existing `X-PS-*` headers.

### 7.12 Telemetry additions (metadata only, per CONTRIBUTING)

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sensitivity_level`, `sensitivity_source` (`declared` / `pii_escalated` / `default`) | CISO evidence |
| `served_provider`, `served_jurisdiction`, `policy_version` | Proof of where each call was served |
| `route_group`, `route_reason`, `route_mode` (`gateway` / `local` / `none`) | Routing evidence |
| `fallback_chain` (error class only) | Reliability |
| `cost_breakdown`, `cost_source` (`reported` / `estimated` / `cache`), `price_catalog_version` | Accurate cost |
| `counterfactual_cost`, `baseline_id` | Verified savings |
| `budget_state` | Governance |

These need nullable columns via Alembic `004_route.py`. Usage-summary APIs are extended
with `savings_usd`, `sovereign_share` and `fallback_rate`.

## 8. Phases, gates and the 6-week test

| Phase | Weeks | Scope | Exit / gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Teardown MVP** | 0–3 | Fix served-model pricing; catalog v1 with cache, reasoning and sovereignty fields; streaming usage; Nordic ID detectors; policy schema v1 and golden vectors; teardown CLI (cost-only mode first, then replay + eval harness v0) | Two concierge teardowns delivered to pipeline accounts (memo: Storebrand, Tetra Tech, CluePoints, Svanemerket, SELENCIA) |
| **Gate 1 (memo)** | 4–6 | — | **Go:** ≥3 of 10 prospects spend more than €5k/month; ≥2 teardowns show ≥30% savings at ≥95% parity; ≥1 paid pilot or LOI. **Kill:** buyers see cost as Microsoft's problem, or teardown savings are <15% → drop routing, keep P0 cost accuracy, move straight to P2 governance (idea B). |
| **P1 — Sensitivity-aware routing** | 6–12 | Gateway router gets a sensitivity input and the constraint stage; OpenAI-compatible sovereign provider adapter; failover engine + circuit breakers; SDK `ShieldsRouter` local mode; counterfactual cost + baseline; telemetry + migration | A pilot customer runs in production behind the gateway; zero jurisdiction violations in property tests and in the pilot; invoice reconciliation within ±2% |
| **P2 — Governance & cache** | 10–16 | Budgets (gateway shared store, SDK Redis store); anomaly alerts; FOCUS export; semantic cache mode; savings dashboards in the registry API | The pilot's FinOps owner uses budgets and alerts; cache savings reported |
| **P3 — Learned routing & anonymise-then-route** | 16+ | RouteLLM-style learned strategy trained on pilot telemetry plus the eval harness; reversible pseudonymisation behind a recall gate | The learned router beats the heuristic on the eval set; the recall target is met before anonymisation is enabled for any tenant |

## 9. Success metrics

- **Teardown:** turnaround of 1 working day or less; ≥30% savings at ≥95% parity on ≥2 of
  the first 3 teardowns (the memo's go criterion).
- **Safety:** zero calls served outside the allowed jurisdiction. This is measured
  continuously from `served_jurisdiction` against `sensitivity_level`.
- **Accuracy:** cost within ±2% of the invoice for the reconciled period.
- **Reliability:** ≥99% success with one provider forced down (failover test).
- **Overhead:** under 10 ms p50 for classify + route at the gateway, with no network I/O on the hot path.
- **Commercial:** paid pilots or LOIs; share of revenue from savings-share contracts.

## 10. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Commoditisation (OpenRouter, hyperscalers, Microsoft Foundry routing) | Compete on sensitivity + evidence + attribution, not on breadth or price (P2) |
| EU provider capacity shortages | Mandatory multi-provider failover within the constraint set; circuit breakers; at least two sovereign providers per restricted policy |
| Quality liability on regulated tasks | Per-use-case eval eligibility; conservative `min_group`; no fallback after a content-filter refusal |
| A regex PII engine misses sensitive data | Escalate-only design; `unclassified_default: confidential`; checksummed Nordic IDs; no prompt rewriting until the recall gate is met |
| Savings claims disputed | Frozen baseline, versioned catalog, invoice reconciliation, methodology appendix |
| Focus dilution versus the ASPM roadmap | Phase 0 is mostly tooling (catalog, cost fix, teardown), which is useful even on the kill path; online routing is built only after Gate 1 |
| Breaking the "the SDK never picks a model" contract | Local routing is opt-in through `ShieldsRouter`; existing clients unchanged; docs updated in the P1 PR |
| Secondary-source market data | Validate before investor or external use (memo risk list) |

## 11. Open questions

1. *(Memo)* Is this a new SKU, or the reason to buy Prompt Shields at all? This decides
   whether the teardown is free, which would make it a lead magnet.
2. *(Memo)* Which two pipeline accounts will share logs within 3 weeks? Will they accept
   running the CLI locally?
3. *(Memo)* Partner with Melious and EUrouter as supply, or only integrate the
   underlying providers directly?
4. *(Memo)* Is there a Norway-hosted provider or Nscale capacity for a `NO` jurisdiction
   in the restricted tier?
5. Does a US-headquartered provider's EU region count as `EEA` for `confidential`?
   Proposal: allowed only when `us_cloud_act_exposure` is accepted by the customer policy.
6. Savings-share baseline: the customer's actual historical mix, or a list-price
   "naive" baseline? Proposal: the historical mix, frozen at onboarding.

## Appendix A — Research notes

- **OpenRouter:**
  - `models[]` ordered fallback
  - `provider { order, only, ignore, sort, max_price, zdr, data_collection, quantizations }`
  - exact `usage.cost` on every response
  - `:floor` / `:nitro` variants
  - Auto Router with a candidate allow-list
  - sticky provider routing to keep caches warm

  We reuse this vocabulary in `ProviderPrefs`.
- **LiteLLM:** price-map schema (adopted); separate fallback classes (context window,
  content policy); budgets per key, user and team. The 2026 breach supports the memo's
  "trusted, hardened gateway" pitch.
- **Portkey** (our gateway's upstream): `strategy.mode` fallback / loadbalance /
  conditional; simple and semantic cache.
- **RouteLLM:** strong-versus-weak learned router with a calibrated threshold. This is
  the P3 starting point.
- **Melious** (memo): 60+ open-weight models across 11 EU providers, routing variants
  by name suffix, no visible enterprise governance layer. It is *supply*, not a template.
